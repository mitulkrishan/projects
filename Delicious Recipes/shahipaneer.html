            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 tomato, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1/4 cup cashew nuts, ground</li>
            <li>1/4 cup milk or cream</li>

        <h2>Steps to Prepare</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut 200g of paneer into cubes. Soak 10-12 cashew nuts in warm water for 10-15 minutes, then grind them into a smooth paste.</li>
    <li>Heat 2 tablespoons of ghee or oil in a pan. Add 1 teaspoon of cumin seeds and let them splutter.</li>
    <li>Add 2 finely chopped onions and sauté until golden brown.</li>
    <li>Add 1 tablespoon of ginger-garlic paste and sauté for a minute until the raw smell disappears.</li>
    <li>Add 2 finely chopped tomatoes and cook until they become soft and mushy.</li>
    <li>Add the cashew nut paste and cook for 2-3 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add 1 teaspoon of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of red chili powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander powder, and salt to taste. Cook the mixture for a few more minutes until the oil starts to separate.</li>
    <li>Add the paneer cubes to the gravy and mix gently so that the paneer is well coated with the masala.</li>
    <li>Add 1/2 cup of fresh cream and 1/2 cup of milk. Stir well and cook for another 3-4 minutes on low heat.</li>
    <li>Add 1 teaspoon of garam masala and mix gently.</li>
    <li>Garnish with fresh coriander leaves and a few saffron strands soaked in a little milk.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with naan, roti, or steamed rice.</li>
